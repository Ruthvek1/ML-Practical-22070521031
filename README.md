## 1) Explore open-source libraries like NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. Load a dataset and perform basic statistical analysis and visualizations.
## 2) Apply PCA to reduce dimensions of a high-dimensional dataset (e.g., Wine or Digit dataset) and visualize the transformed components.
## 3) Perform missing value handling, outlier detection, label encoding, and feature scaling on a real-world dataset (e.g., Student Performance or Housing Prices).
## 4) Use the KNN algorithm to classify flowers in the Iris dataset. Tune the value of ‘K’ and evaluate accuracy using confusion matrix.
## 5) Classify SMS messages as spam or ham using the Naïve Bayes algorithm. Use text preprocessing and evaluate model performance.
## 6) Build a decision tree to classify patients as diabetic or not (using PIMA dataset). Visualize the decision tree
## 7) Compare accuracy of Random Forest vs Decision Tree on the same dataset. Analyze feature importance.
## 8) Predict student test scores based on hours studied using simple linear regression. Plot regression line and calculate error metrics.
## 9) Predict house prices based on multiple features (e.g., area, number of rooms, location) using Multiple Linear Regression.
## 10) Classify whether a user buys a product or not based on age and salary using Logistic Regression.
## 11) Cluster customers based on their annual income and spending score (Mall Customers dataset). Visualize the clusters.
## 12) Identify buying patterns from market basket data using the Apriori algorithm. Generate frequent itemsets and association rules.
## 13) Build a simple feed-forward neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
## 14) Use cross-validation and grid search to tune hyperparameters of a classification model (e.g., SVM or Random Forest).
